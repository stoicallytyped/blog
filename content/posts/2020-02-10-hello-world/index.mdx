## Hello, World! 

As with all new endeavors within the technology bubble, here I am with my blog equivalent of Hello, World!
Thanks for stopping by! I'm so glad you're here. I've been wanting to start writing for a while as a way to practice creating a clearer, more thorough, thought process. I also want to give back to the technology community that has helped me get to where I am today and hopefully help someone along their journey. The fast paced world of technology can be an intimidating one and no one should fear having to traverse it alone.
 
I've actually been putting this on and off and on and off for a while. There are so many ways to start a blog nowadays and I was a subject of _analysis paralysis_. I've tried [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), checked out [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), jumped to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), attempted publishing with [Publii](https://getpublii.com/) and have finally fallen back on Gatsby. Each of these new beginnings were great ways to explore these static web technologies (and the addictive nature of near instant iteration). This distraction is definitely part of the reason I have had such a hard time commiting to one blogging solution. While that has been fun I've finally realized that exploring these technologies is not the reason I wanted to start this project. The purpose is to write. Log information for you and future me. Think and communicate clearly. Create content. Tell stories. Demonstrate failures and what was learned overcoming them. To provide resources for any who may need them.
 
Thanks for stopping by and giving me some of your time. I hope you come back for more (especially when there is more, I'm working on it I promise). In the meantime feel free to reach out on Twitter at [@matthewcmckenna](https://twitter.com/matthewcmckenns) or [@StoicallyTyped](https://twitter.com/stoicallytyped)
