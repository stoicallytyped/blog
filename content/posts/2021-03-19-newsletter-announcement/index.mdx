# Have I got news for you!

Well, I actually do!

The StoicallyTyped Newsletter is a weekly dose of bite sized Android news and events delivered Monday mornings to start off your week.

Each issue will contain TL;DRs of recent Android news and events, perfect for your short build times.

If your build times are a little longer there will also be Android specific interview/best practice questions to keep you on your toes and promote knowledge sharing!

Do you like discovering new tools to increase your productivity, quality of life, or just like to have fun playing with something new? That's included too.

Lastly, there will be a stoic sentiment and how it can be applied to your tech career.

The first issue is coming on Monday, March 22nd so be sure to [<u><b>subscribe</b></u>](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/stoicallytyped)!
